# 🔧 Auth & API Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Auth State Not Persisting on Page Reload

**Problem:** Every time you reload the page, you get redirected to login.

**Root Cause:** Token and user data were stored in `localStorage` but not being restored properly on app initialization.

**Solution:**
- Changed from `localStorage` to `sessionStorage` (more appropriate for session-based auth)
- Updated `stores/auth.ts` to use `sessionStorage` for token storage
- Updated `middleware/auth.ts` to call `initAuth()` before checking authentication
- `app.vue` already calls `initAuth()` on mount

**Files Modified:**
- `stores/auth.ts` - Changed all `localStorage` to `sessionStorage`
- `middleware/auth.ts` - Added `authStore.initAuth()` call before auth check

### 2. ✅ API Errors: upcoming-events & activity-logs

**Problem:** Both APIs returning 500 errors:
```
[GET] "/api/upcoming-events?days=7": 500 Server Error
[GET] "/api/activity-logs?days=7": 500 Server Error
```

**Root Cause:** Database views were missing required columns:
- `v_upcoming_events` was missing `status` and `payment_status` columns
- `v_user_activity` was missing `description` column

**Solution:**
Updated both views to include missing columns:

**v_upcoming_events:**
- Added `e.status` column
- Added `payment_status` calculated column (Paid/Partial/Unpaid based on payment records)

**v_user_activity:**
- Added `description` column (concatenated string describing the activity)

**Files Modified:**
- `database/views/all_views.sql` - Updated view definitions
- `server/api/upcoming-events.get.ts` - Added detailed error logging
- `server/api/activity-logs.get.ts` - Added detailed error logging

**New Files Created:**
- `database/views/update_phase4_views.sql` - SQL script to update views
- `update-views.js` - Node script to update views programmatically

## 📋 Manual Steps Required

### Run the SQL Script to Update Database Views

**Option 1: Using MySQL Workbench or Command Line**
```bash
mysql -u root -p rosewood_events < database/views/update_phase4_views.sql
```

**Option 2: Copy/Paste in MySQL Workbench**
1. Open `database/views/update_phase4_views.sql`
2. Copy all content
3. Paste into MySQL Workbench
4. Execute

**Option 3: Using Node Script**
```bash
node update-views.js
```

## 🧪 Testing After Fix

### 1. Test Auth Persistence
1. Login to the application
2. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or F5)
3. ✅ You should stay logged in (not redirected to login)

### 2. Test Dashboard
1. Go to dashboard (`/`)
2. ✅ Should see "Upcoming Events" widget without errors
3. ✅ Events should display with days countdown

### 3. Test Activity Logs
1. Go to Activity Logs (`/activity-logs`)
2. ✅ Should see list of activities without errors
3. ✅ Try filtering by action type

## 🔍 How Auth Now Works

1. **Login Flow:**
   ```
   User enters credentials
   → API validates
   → Token generated
   → Token + user saved to sessionStorage
   → Pinia store updated
   → User redirected to dashboard
   ```

2. **Page Reload Flow:**
   ```
   Page loads
   → app.vue calls authStore.initAuth()
   → initAuth reads from sessionStorage
   → Pinia store restored with token + user
   → Middleware checks auth
   → User stays on current page
   ```

3. **Logout Flow:**
   ```
   User clicks logout
   → sessionStorage cleared
   → Pinia store cleared
   → User redirected to login
   ```

## 📊 View Updates Summary

### v_upcoming_events
**Before:** 10 columns
**After:** 12 columns
**Added:**
- `status` - Event status (inquiry, confirmed, etc.)
- `payment_status` - Payment completion status (Paid/Partial/Unpaid)

### v_user_activity
**Before:** 9 columns
**After:** 10 columns
**Added:**
- `description` - Human-readable activity description

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the SQL script: `database/views/update_phase4_views.sql`
2. ✅ Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
3. ✅ Clear browser cache and sessionStorage (F12 → Application → Storage → Clear)
4. ✅ Login again
5. ✅ Test all features

## 🎯 Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

✅ **No more auth redirects** on page reload
✅ **Upcoming Events widget works** on dashboard
✅ **Activity Logs page works** with filtering
✅ **Session persists** across page refreshes
✅ **Clean error messages** if something goes wrong

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **sessionStorage vs localStorage**: We use sessionStorage because it's cleared when browser tab closes, which is more appropriate for session-based authentication
- **View columns**: The APIs were trying to SELECT columns that didn't exist in the views, causing SQL errors
- **Auth initialization**: Must happen before middleware checks, otherwise fresh page loads fail
- **Error logging**: Added detailed error logging to help debug future issues

## 🔒 Security Note

This implementation uses sessionStorage for simplicity as mentioned by the user. For production:
- Consider adding token refresh mechanism
- Add token expiration validation
- Consider httpOnly cookies for better security
- Add CSRF protection

But for a project/demo app, sessionStorage is perfectly fine! 👍
