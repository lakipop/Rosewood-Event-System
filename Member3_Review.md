1. Add Service to Event (Feature on Event Details)
Purpose: This feature allows event managers to add specific services to an event. For example, adding catering, photography, or decoration services to a wedding or corporate event.
Key Functionality:
Validates the availability of the selected service.
Ensures no duplicate services are added to the same event.
Calculates the total cost based on the service price and quantity.
Backend Integration:
Uses the stored procedure sp_add_event_service(...) to handle validation and insertion at the database level.
Triggers like tr_after_service_add log the addition of services for auditing purposes.
User Experience:
The feature is accessible from the event details page, making it easy to manage services for a specific event.
2. Process Payment (Feature on Event Details)
Purpose: This feature enables event managers to record payments made by clients for their events.
Key Functionality:
Validates the payment amount to ensure it does not exceed the remaining balance for the event.
Supports multiple payment methods (e.g., cash, card, bank transfer).
Automatically generates a unique payment reference number for each transaction.
Backend Integration:
Uses the stored procedure sp_process_payment(...) to ensure atomicity and validation of payment transactions.
Triggers like tr_generate_payment_reference and tr_after_payment_insert automate reference generation and logging.
The trigger tr_update_event_status_on_payment automatically updates the event status to "confirmed" if the payment covers the total cost.
User Experience:
Payments can be processed directly from the event details page, providing a seamless workflow for event managers.
3. Payments List (/payments)
Purpose: This page provides a comprehensive list of all payments made across events, allowing managers to track financial transactions.
Key Functionality:
Displays payment details such as date, amount, method, and reference number.
Allows filtering and searching by event, client, or payment status.
Backend Integration:
Uses the view v_payment_summary to aggregate and display payment data efficiently.
Indexes like idx_payments_event_id optimize payment lookups by event.
User Experience:
The page is designed for quick access to payment records, making it easy to audit and reconcile transactions.
4. Services Catalog (/services)
Purpose: This page lists all available services that can be added to events, helping managers and clients choose the right services.
Key Functionality:
Displays service details such as name, description, price, and availability.
Provides insights into service popularity and revenue generation.
Backend Integration:
Uses the view v_service_stats to aggregate booking data and calculate revenue per service.
Indexes like idx_event_services_event_service prevent duplicate entries and optimize queries.
User Experience:
The catalog is user-friendly, allowing managers to browse and select services efficiently.
Summary
These pages collectively form the backbone of the Services & Payments Module, enabling efficient management of services and financial transactions. Member 3's implementation ensures data integrity, automation, and performance optimization, making these features robust and user-friendly.
