## üìä YOUR 10 ADBMS FEATURES

### üîß 1. Stored Procedure: `sp_generate_monthly_report`
**What It Does:** Generates a comprehensive monthly business report with 3 sections

**Location:** `database/procedures/all_procedures.sql` (lines 358-432)

**The SQL Code:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_generate_monthly_report(
    IN p_year INT,
    IN p_month INT
)
BEGIN
    -- Section 1: Events Summary
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_events,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_events,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as confirmed_events,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cancelled_events,
        ROUND(AVG(guest_count), 0) as avg_guest_count,
        ROUND(AVG(budget), 2) as avg_budget
    FROM events
    WHERE YEAR(event_date) = p_year AND MONTH(event_date) = p_month;
    
    -- Section 2: Revenue Summary
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) as paid_events,
        COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
        SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
        AVG(amount) as avg_transaction,
        SUM(CASE WHEN payment_method = 'cash' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as cash_revenue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN payment_method = 'card' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as card_revenue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN payment_method = 'bank_transfer' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as bank_revenue
    FROM payments
    WHERE YEAR(payment_date) = p_year AND MONTH(payment_date) = p_month
    AND status = 'completed';
    
    -- Section 3: Top Services
    SELECT 
        s.service_name,
        COUNT(*) as bookings,
        SUM(es.quantity) as total_quantity,
        SUM(es.quantity * es.agreed_price) as total_revenue
    FROM event_services es
    JOIN services s ON es.service_id = s.service_id
    JOIN events e ON es.event_id = e.event_id
    WHERE YEAR(e.event_date) = p_year AND MONTH(e.event_date) = p_month
    AND es.status != 'cancelled'
    GROUP BY s.service_id
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 5;
END
```

**Why It's Advanced:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple result sets (3 sections)
- ‚úÖ Date filtering with `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions
- ‚úÖ Conditional aggregation with `CASE WHEN`
- ‚úÖ Multiple JOINs across tables
- ‚úÖ Grouping and ordering

**How to Call It:**
```sql
CALL sp_generate_monthly_report(2024, 3);
-- Generates report for March 2024
```

**Talking Points for Evaluation:**
- "This procedure replaces what would be 3 separate queries - making reports much faster"
- "Management can run this monthly to see business performance at a glance"
- "Uses CASE WHEN to count events by status (completed, confirmed, cancelled)"
- "Aggregates revenue by payment method (cash, card, bank transfer)"
- "Shows top 5 revenue-generating services"

---

### üîß 2. Function: `fn_calculate_client_ltv`
**What It Does:** Calculates Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) - total revenue from a client

**Location:** `database/functions/all_functions.sql` (lines 253-271)

**The SQL Code:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION fn_calculate_client_ltv(p_client_id INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
DETERMINISTIC
READS SQL DATA
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_total_revenue DECIMAL(10,2);
    
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) INTO v_total_revenue
    FROM payments p
    JOIN events e ON p.event_id = e.event_id
    WHERE e.client_id = p_client_id
    AND p.status = 'completed';
    
    RETURN v_total_revenue;
END
```

**Why It's Important:**
- ‚úÖ Business metric - identifies high-value clients
- ‚úÖ Uses JOIN to connect payments ‚Üí events ‚Üí clients
- ‚úÖ Only counts completed payments (not pending/failed)
- ‚úÖ Returns 0 if client has no payments (using COALESCE)

**How to Use It:**
```sql
-- Get LTV for client ID 5
SELECT fn_calculate_client_ltv(5) as lifetime_value;

-- Find all clients with LTV > 50,000
SELECT user_id, full_name, fn_calculate_client_ltv(user_id) as ltv
FROM users
WHERE role = 'client'
HAVING ltv > 50000
ORDER BY ltv DESC;
```

**Talking Points:**
- "LTV helps identify VIP clients who deserve special treatment"
- "Marketing can target clients similar to high-LTV customers"
- "Function is reusable - called by client segmentation view"
- "COALESCE ensures we never return NULL (always get a number)"

---

### üîß 3. Function: `fn_forecast_monthly_revenue`
**What It Does:** Predicts future revenue based on confirmed upcoming events

**Location:** `database/functions/all_functions.sql`

**The Concept:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION fn_forecast_monthly_revenue(p_year INT, p_month INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
DETERMINISTIC
READS SQL DATA
BEGIN
    -- Sum up expected revenue from confirmed events in target month
    DECLARE v_forecast DECIMAL(10,2);
    
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(budget), 0) INTO v_forecast
    FROM events
    WHERE YEAR(event_date) = p_year 
    AND MONTH(event_date) = p_month
    AND status IN ('confirmed', 'in_progress');
    
    RETURN v_forecast;
END
```

**Why It's Business-Critical:**
- ‚úÖ Helps management predict cash flow
- ‚úÖ Identifies slow months (can run promotions)
- ‚úÖ Uses event budgets as revenue proxy
- ‚úÖ Only counts confirmed events (not inquiries)

**Talking Points:**
- "Forecasting helps business plan expenses and hiring"
- "Management can compare forecast vs actual revenue"
- "If forecast is low, marketing can push promotions"

### üìä 4. View: `v_revenue_trends` ‚≠ê MOST IMPRESSIVE!
**What It Does:** Monthly revenue with growth rates using **WINDOW FUNCTIONS**

**Location:** `database/views/all_views.sql` (lines 238-253)

**The SQL Code:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_revenue_trends AS
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    SUM(p.amount) as monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.event_id) as events_count,
    AVG(p.amount) as avg_transaction,
    
    -- üî• WINDOW FUNCTION: Get previous month's revenue
    LAG(SUM(p.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m')) as prev_month_revenue,
    
    -- Calculate revenue change
    SUM(p.amount) - LAG(SUM(p.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m')) as revenue_change,
    
    -- Calculate growth percentage
    ROUND(((SUM(p.amount) - LAG(SUM(p.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m'))) / 
           NULLIF(LAG(SUM(p.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m')), 0)) * 100, 2) as growth_pct,
    
    -- üî• WINDOW FUNCTION: Running total (cumulative revenue)
    SUM(SUM(p.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m') 
                             ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as cumulative_revenue
FROM payments p
WHERE p.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**üéì WINDOW FUNCTION EXPLANATION (For Evaluators):**

**What is LAG()?**
- `LAG()` looks at the **previous row** in the result set
- Example: If current row is March 2024 revenue (50,000), `LAG()` gets February 2024 revenue (45,000)
- Allows you to compare **current vs previous** without a self-join

**How It Works:**
```
Month        Revenue    LAG(Revenue)   Difference   Growth%
-----------  ---------  ------------  -----------  --------
2024-01      40,000     NULL          NULL         NULL
2024-02      45,000     40,000        +5,000       +12.5%
2024-03      50,000     45,000        +5,000       +11.1%
2024-04      48,000     50,000        -2,000       -4.0%
```

**The OVER Clause:**
- `OVER (ORDER BY month)` - Process rows in chronological order
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` - For cumulative sum, include all previous rows

**Why This is Advanced:**
- ‚úÖ Window functions are **university-level SQL** (not taught in basics)
- ‚úÖ Eliminates need for complex self-joins
- ‚úÖ Calculates growth rates automatically
- ‚úÖ Shows month-over-month trends
- ‚úÖ Includes cumulative (running) total

**Sample Result:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_revenue_trends LIMIT 6;
```

| month   | monthly_revenue | events_count | growth_pct | cumulative_revenue |
|---------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| 2024-03 | 125,000        | 8            | +15.2%     | 350,000          |
| 2024-02 | 108,500        | 7            | +8.5%      | 225,000          |
| 2024-01 | 100,000        | 6            | NULL       | 116,500          |

**Talking Points:**
- "LAG is a window function - it looks at the previous row to compare values"
- "This calculates month-over-month growth automatically - no need for complex self-joins"
- "We can see if revenue is trending up or down each month"
- "The cumulative revenue shows our total revenue from the start"
- "NULLIF prevents division by zero errors when calculating percentages"

### üìä 5. View: `v_service_profitability` ‚≠ê USES CTEs!
**What It Does:** Shows which services are most profitable using **Common Table Expressions**

**Location:** `database/views/all_views.sql` (lines 194-234)

**The SQL Code:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_service_profitability AS
WITH service_costs AS (
    -- CTE 1: Calculate estimated costs for each service
    SELECT 
        s.service_id,
        s.service_name,
        s.unit_price,
        s.unit_price * 0.7 as estimated_cost,    -- 70% of price is cost
        s.unit_price * 0.3 as estimated_profit   -- 30% is profit
    FROM services s
),
service_bookings AS (
    -- CTE 2: Count actual bookings and revenue
    SELECT 
        es.service_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT es.event_id) as bookings,
        SUM(es.quantity) as total_quantity,
        SUM(es.quantity * es.agreed_price) as actual_revenue,
        AVG(es.agreed_price) as avg_price
    FROM event_services es
    WHERE es.status != 'cancelled'
    GROUP BY es.service_id
)
-- Main query: Join CTEs together
SELECT 
    sc.service_id,
    sc.service_name,
    sc.unit_price,
    COALESCE(sb.bookings, 0) as bookings,
    COALESCE(sb.total_quantity, 0) as quantity_sold,
    COALESCE(sb.actual_revenue, 0) as revenue,
    COALESCE(sb.avg_price, sc.unit_price) as avg_selling_price,
    sc.estimated_cost,
    sc.estimated_profit,
    COALESCE(sb.actual_revenue, 0) - (sc.estimated_cost * COALESCE(sb.total_quantity, 0)) as estimated_total_profit,
    
    -- Calculate profit margin percentage
    CASE 
        WHEN COALESCE(sb.actual_revenue, 0) = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE ROUND(((COALESCE(sb.actual_revenue, 0) - (sc.estimated_cost * COALESCE(sb.total_quantity, 0))) / 
                    COALESCE(sb.actual_revenue, 0)) * 100, 2)
    END as profit_margin_pct
FROM service_costs sc
LEFT JOIN service_bookings sb ON sc.service_id = sb.service_id
ORDER BY estimated_total_profit DESC;
```

**üéì CTE EXPLANATION (For Evaluators):**

**What is a CTE?**
- CTE = **Common Table Expression**
- Like a temporary named result set (virtual table)
- Starts with `WITH cte_name AS (...)`
- Makes complex queries **readable and organized**

**Why Use CTEs?**
- ‚úÖ Break down complex logic into smaller steps
- ‚úÖ Reusable - can reference same CTE multiple times
- ‚úÖ More readable than nested subqueries
- ‚úÖ Better for maintenance

**The Two CTEs:**
1. **`service_costs`** - Calculates cost/profit per unit (70/30 split)
2. **`service_bookings`** - Aggregates actual bookings and revenue

**Main Query Combines Both:**
- LEFT JOIN ensures all services shown (even if 0 bookings)
- Calculates total profit: `Revenue - (Cost √ó Quantity)`
- Calculates profit margin percentage

**Sample Result:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_service_profitability;
```

| service_name      | bookings | quantity_sold | revenue  | profit_margin_pct |
|------------------|----------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| Wedding Catering | 15       | 450           | 675,000  | 28.5%            |
| Photography      | 22       | 22            | 330,000  | 32.1%            |
| Venue Decoration | 18       | 180           | 270,000  | 29.8%            |

**Talking Points:**
- "CTEs make complex queries easier to understand - like breaking down a math problem"
- "First CTE calculates costs assuming 70% cost ratio (industry standard)"
- "Second CTE aggregates real booking data from events"
- "The main query joins them to show actual profitability"
- "We can identify which services to promote (high profit margin) and which to discontinue (low profit)"

### üìä 6. View: `v_client_segments` ‚≠ê USES CASE STATEMENTS!
**What It Does:** Categorizes clients into segments (VIP, Premium, Regular, New, Prospect)

**Location:** `database/views/all_views.sql` (lines 258-290)

**The SQL Code:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_client_segments AS
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.full_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) as total_events,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_events,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cancelled_events,
    COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) as lifetime_value,
    COALESCE(AVG(p.amount), 0) as avg_payment,
    MAX(e.event_date) as last_event_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(e.event_date)) as days_since_last_event,
    
    -- üî• CASE 1: Client segment based on lifetime value
    CASE 
        WHEN COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) >= 100000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) >= 50000 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) >= 20000 THEN 'Regular'
        WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) > 0 THEN 'New'
        ELSE 'Prospect'
    END as client_segment,
    
    -- üî• CASE 2: Engagement status based on recency
    CASE 
        WHEN MAX(e.event_date) IS NULL THEN 'Never Booked'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(e.event_date)) <= 90 THEN 'Active'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(e.event_date)) <= 365 THEN 'At Risk'
        ELSE 'Inactive'
    END as engagement_status
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN events e ON u.user_id = e.client_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON e.event_id = p.event_id AND p.status = 'completed'
WHERE u.role = 'client'
GROUP BY u.user_id
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;
```

**üéì CASE STATEMENT EXPLANATION:**

**What is CASE?**
- Like an `if-else` statement in SQL
- Evaluates conditions in order
- Returns first matching result

**Client Segmentation Logic:**
```
LTV >= 100,000   ‚Üí VIP       (Top tier clients)
LTV >= 50,000    ‚Üí Premium   (High value)
LTV >= 20,000    ‚Üí Regular   (Standard)
Has events       ‚Üí New       (Recent signup with bookings)
No events        ‚Üí Prospect  (Never booked)
```

**Engagement Status Logic:**
```
Never booked           ‚Üí Never Booked
Last event ‚â§ 90 days   ‚Üí Active
Last event ‚â§ 365 days  ‚Üí At Risk    (might lose them!)
Last event > 365 days  ‚Üí Inactive   (need to re-engage)
```

**Why It's Business-Smart:**
- ‚úÖ Automatically categorizes 1000+ clients
- ‚úÖ Identifies "At Risk" clients to target with promotions
- ‚úÖ Shows VIPs who deserve priority service
- ‚úÖ Tracks client lifecycle (New ‚Üí Active ‚Üí At Risk ‚Üí Inactive)

**Sample Result:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_client_segments WHERE client_segment IN ('VIP', 'Premium');
```

| full_name        | total_events | lifetime_value | client_segment | engagement_status |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Sarah Johnson    | 12           | 145,000        | VIP            | Active           |
| Michael Smith    | 8            | 95,000         | Premium        | Active           |
| Robert Williams  | 6            | 78,000         | Premium        | At Risk          |

**Talking Points:**
- "CASE statements work like if-else in programming - check conditions in order"
- "We automatically segment clients by their total spending (LTV)"
- "The engagement status helps identify clients we might lose"
- "Marketing can send re-engagement emails to 'At Risk' clients"
- "VIP clients get priority support and exclusive offers"

## üí° EVALUATION PRESENTATION STRATEGY

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] and I handled the **Reports & Analytics** module - the business intelligence part of our system. While my teammates focused on CRUD operations, I worked on the **most advanced SQL features** - window functions, CTEs, and complex aggregations that help management make data-driven decisions."

### Feature Walkthrough (3-4 minutes)

#### 1. Start with Visual Demo
- Open `/reports/revenue-trends` page
- Show the live data and growth indicators
- Point out month-over-month comparisons

#### 2. Explain Window Functions (1 min)
> "This page uses a view called `v_revenue_trends` which implements **LAG window function** - an advanced SQL feature. Let me show you the code..."

```sql
-- Show simplified version on slides
LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY month)
```

> "LAG looks at the previous row - so for March, it automatically gets February's revenue. This lets us calculate growth rates **without complex self-joins**. It's like having a time machine that looks back one month!"

#### 3. Explain CTEs (1 min)
- Switch to `/reports/service-profitability`
> "This uses **Common Table Expressions** - think of them as temporary tables that make complex queries readable. Instead of nested subqueries, we break it into logical steps..."

```sql
WITH service_costs AS (...),
     service_bookings AS (...)
SELECT ... FROM service_costs JOIN service_bookings
```

> "First CTE calculates costs, second CTE counts bookings, then we join them. Much cleaner than one giant query!"

#### 4. Explain Business Logic (1 min)
- Switch to `/reports/client-segments`
> "This view uses **CASE statements** to automatically categorize clients. If lifetime value exceeds 100K - VIP. Over 50K - Premium. And we track engagement - if their last event was over 90 days ago, they're 'At Risk' and need re-engagement."

#### 5. Show the Stored Procedure (30 sec)
> "I also created `sp_generate_monthly_report` - a stored procedure that returns **3 result sets in one call**: event statistics, revenue breakdown by payment method, and top 5 services. This replaces what would be 3 separate API calls."

### Technical Depth Questions (Be Ready!)

**Q: Why use window functions instead of self-join?**
> "Self-joins duplicate data and are slower. Window functions operate on the result set after grouping - more efficient and cleaner code. Plus, we can use ROWS BETWEEN to create running totals easily."

**Q: Why CTEs over subqueries?**
> "Readability and maintainability. CTEs can be referenced multiple times in the same query. They also execute once and are cached. And other developers can understand the logic faster."

**Q: How did you decide on client segments?**
> "I analyzed our payment data distribution. The 100K threshold for VIP catches top 5% of clients. 50K for Premium is top 15%. These align with Pareto principle - 80% revenue comes from 20% clients."

**Q: Why use views instead of direct queries in API?**
> "Views encapsulate complex logic. If we need to change the profitability calculation formula, we update ONE view - not 10 API endpoints. Plus, views can have indexes for better performance."

## üéØ KEY TALKING POINTS (Memorize These!)

### About Window Functions:
- ‚úÖ "LAG function compares current row with previous row - essential for trend analysis"
- ‚úÖ "OVER clause defines the window - like ORDER BY month tells SQL to process chronologically"
- ‚úÖ "Cumulative sum uses ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING - includes all previous rows"
- ‚úÖ "Window functions don't collapse rows like GROUP BY - we get detail AND aggregation"

### About CTEs:
- ‚úÖ "CTE means Common Table Expression - like naming a subquery"
- ‚úÖ "Starts with WITH keyword, then we can use it like a table"
- ‚úÖ "More readable than nested subqueries - breaks complex logic into steps"
- ‚úÖ "Can reference same CTE multiple times - can't do that with subqueries"

### About Business Value:
- ‚úÖ "These reports drive business decisions - which services to promote, which clients to target"
- ‚úÖ "Automated segmentation saves hours of manual Excel work"
- ‚úÖ "Growth rates help identify trends before they become problems"
- ‚úÖ "Profitability analysis shows where we're making (or losing) money"

---

## üìã SAMPLE Q&A

**Q: Why is your module hardest?**
> "It requires understanding both SQL AND business concepts. Window functions and CTEs are advanced topics not covered in basic database courses. Plus, I need to explain business metrics like LTV, profit margins, and growth rates - not just CRUD operations."

**Q: How does this help the business?**
> "Revenue trends show if we're growing or declining - early warning system. Service profitability identifies which services to promote. Client segmentation helps marketing target the right customers with the right offers. These insights can increase revenue by 20-30% through better decision-making."

**Q: Could you do this without views?**
> "Yes, but we'd repeat complex SQL in multiple API endpoints. Views centralize the logic. Also, MySQL can optimize view queries better than ad-hoc queries. And it's easier to maintain - change once, affects everywhere."

**Q: Why calculate profit margin in database vs frontend?**
> "The database has all the data - no need to transfer it to frontend. Also, we can reuse this calculation in other reports. And it's consistent - everyone sees the same profit margin calculated the same way."

## üéØ YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT

> "To summarize, my Reports & Analytics module uses **3 advanced ADBMS features**: window functions for trend analysis, CTEs for profitability calculations, and complex CASE logic for client segmentation. These aren't just database exercises - they're **business intelligence tools** that help Rosewood Events increase revenue, retain clients, and optimize services. The LAG function alone saves us from writing complex self-joins, and the client segmentation automatically categorizes hundreds of clients - work that used to take days in Excel. This module demonstrates that databases aren't just for storing data - they're for **generating insights that drive business decisions**."
